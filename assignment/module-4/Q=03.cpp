//DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OOP AND POP
->OOP (Object-Oriented Programming):
	
1)Organizes code into objects or classes.
2)Emphasizes data abstraction through encapsulation.
3)Supports inheritance and polymorphism.
4)Models real-world entities.
5)Well-suited for complex systems.
6)Promotes code reusability through classes.

->POP (Procedural Programming):

1)Organizes code into procedures or functions.
2)May not provide strong data abstraction.
3)Doesn't emphasize inheritance and polymorphism.
4)Focuses on step-by-step execution.
5)Suitable for simpler tasks and scripts.
6)Achieves code reusability through functions.
