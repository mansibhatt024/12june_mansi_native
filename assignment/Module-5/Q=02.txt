Q=2 What is Normalization? 
 - In database management systems (DBMS), normal forms are a series of guidelines that help to ensure that the design of a database is efficient, organized, and free from data anomalies.
 - There are several levels of normalization, each with its own set of guidelines, known as normal forms.
*First Normal Form (1NF): 
            -A table is in 1NF if it does not contain repeating groups and all entries in each column are atomic or indivisible.
            -In simpler terms, each column must have a single, indivisible value, and each row must be unique.

*Second Normal Form (2NF):
           - A table is in 2NF if it is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.
           - In other words, all the columns in the table must depend only on the entire primary key, not on a part of it.

*Third Normal Form (3NF):
           - A table is in 3NF if it is in 2NF and it does not have transitive dependencies.
           - Transitive dependency means that if A depends on B, and B depends on C, then A depends on C. 
           - In a table in 3NF, non-key columns are not dependent on other non-key columns.
