structure:
	-structure stores each member in seprate memory allocation.
	-the struct is keyword to define structure.
	-The size of a structure is equal or greater to the sum of the sizes of each data member.
	-changing the value of a member not affect the other variables value.
	-it allows accessing and retrieving any data member at a time.
	-Each variable member occupied a unique memory space.
	-The structure allows initializing multiple variable members at once.
	
	
	
union:
    -union stores each member in same memory allocation.
    -union is keyword to define union.
	-The size of a union is equal to the size of its largest data member size.
	-changing the value of one member affects the other variables value.
	-It allows accessing and retrieving any one data member at a time.
	-Variables members share the memory space of the largest size variable.
	-Union allows initializing only one variable member at once
