In how many ways can a CSS be integrated as a web page?
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) can be integrated into a web page in several ways, giving developers flexibility and control over how styles are applied. Here are the most common methods of integrating CSS into a web page:

1.Internal CSS:
CSS can be placed directly within an HTML document using the <style> element in the document  section.   
<head>
    <style>
        body {
            background-color: lightblue;
        }
        h1 {
            color: navy;
        }
    </style>
</head>

2.External CSS:
CSS can be written in a separate file (e.g., styles.css) and linked to the HTML document using the <link> element in the <head> section. This method allows multiple HTML files to share the same styles.
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    </head>

3.Inline CSS:
Styles can be applied directly to individual HTML elements using the style attribute. Inline styles have the highest specificity and override external and internal styles.
<div style="color: red; font-size: 18px;">This is a red text with font size 18px.</div>
