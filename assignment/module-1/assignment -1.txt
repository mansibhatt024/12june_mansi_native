Q=1 what is software? what is software engineer?
-software: is collection of information,instruction & database.
-software engineer: is a person who applies the engineering design process to  design, develop, maintain,test and evaluate computer software.


Q=2  Explain types of software
-1. system software:
    -these software programs are designed to run a computer's application programs and hardware.
    -system software coordinadtes the activities and functions of the hardware and software.
    -it controls the operations of the computer hardware and provides an environment or platform for all the other types of software to work in.
    -the os is the best  example of system software;it manages all the other compute programs.
    -other examples of system  software include the firmware,computer language translators and system utilities.
example-linux,ubuntu etc.

-2. application software:
    -the most common type of software,application software is a computer software package that performs a specific function for a user , or in some cases for another applications.
    -an application can be self contained,or it can be a group of programs that run the application for the user.
    -examples of modern applications include office suites,graphics software,databases and database management programs,web browsers,word processors,software development tools,image editors and communication platforms.
example-microsoft office,paint,powerpoint etc.
  1.mobile app:
     for ex.,camera, whatsapp,photo etc.
  2. web app:
     for ex., chrome,fire fox etc.
  3. desktop app:
     for ex., wordpad,notepad etc.

-3.  programming software:
     -computer programmers use programming software to write code.programming software and programming tools enable develpoers to develop,write,test and debug other software programs.
     -examples of programming software  include assemblers,compliers,debuggers and interpreters.

-4.  driver software:
     -also known as device drivers,this software is often considered a type of system software.
     -device drivers control the devices and peripherals connected to a computer, enabling them to perform their specific tasks.
     -every device that is connected to a computer needs at least one device driver to function.
     -examples include software that comes with any nonstandard hardware,including special game controllers,as well as the software that enables standard hardware,such as usb  storage devices,keyboards, headphones and printers.

-5.  middleware:
     -the term middleware  describes software that mediates between application and system software or between two different kinds of application software.
     - for example-middleware enables microsoft windows to talk excel and word.
     -it is also used to send a remote work request from an application in a computer that has one kind of os, to an application in a computer with a different OS.it also enables newer application to work with leagacy ones.


Q=3  What is SDLC? Explain each phase  of SDLC.
     -the software develpoment  life cycle refers to a methodology  with clearly  defined processes for creating high quality  software. in detail the SDLC methodology focuses on the following phase of software development.
   1)requirement gathering and analysis:
     - during this phase all the relvant information is collected from the customer to develop a product as per their expection.
     - business analyst and project manager set up a meeting with customer to gather all the information like what the customer wants to build,customers requirement of product,what is the purspose of the product,knowledge of product is very important.
     - for example:
