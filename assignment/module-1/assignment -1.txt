Q=1 what is software? what is software engineer?
-software: is collection of information,instruction & database.
-software engineer: is a person who applies the engineering design process to  design, develop, maintain,test and evaluate computer software.


Q=2  Explain types of software
-1. system software:
    -these software programs are designed to run a computer's application programs and hardware.
    -system software coordinadtes the activities and functions of the hardware and software.
    -it controls the operations of the computer hardware and provides an environment or platform for all the other types of software to work in.
    -the os is the best  example of system software;it manages all the other compute programs.
    -other examples of system  software include the firmware,computer language translators and system utilities.
example-linux,ubuntu etc.

-2. application software:
    -the most common type of software,application software is a computer software package that performs a specific function for a user , or in some cases for another applications.
    -an application can be self contained,or it can be a group of programs that run the application for the user.
    -examples of modern applications include office suites,graphics software,databases and database management programs,web browsers,word processors,software development tools,image editors and communication platforms.
example-microsoft office,paint,powerpoint etc.
  1.mobile app:
     for ex.,camera, whatsapp,photo etc.
  2. web app:
     for ex., chrome,fire fox etc.
  3. desktop app:
     for ex., wordpad,notepad etc.

-3.  programming software:
     -computer programmers use programming software to write code.programming software and programming tools enable develpoers to develop,write,test and debug other software programs.
     -examples of programming software  include assemblers,compliers,debuggers and interpreters.

-4.  driver software:
     -also known as device drivers,this software is often considered a type of system software.
     -device drivers control the devices and peripherals connected to a computer, enabling them to perform their specific tasks.
     -every device that is connected to a computer needs at least one device driver to function.
     -examples include software that comes with any nonstandard hardware,including special game controllers,as well as the software that enables standard hardware,such as usb  storage devices,keyboards, headphones and printers.

-5.  middleware:
     -the term middleware  describes software that mediates between application and system software or between two different kinds of application software.
     - for example-middleware enables microsoft windows to talk excel and word.
     -it is also used to send a remote work request from an application in a computer that has one kind of os, to an application in a computer with a different OS.it also enables newer application to work with leagacy ones.


Q=3  What is SDLC? Explain each phase  of SDLC.
     -the software develpoment  life cycle refers to a methodology  with clearly  defined processes for creating high quality  software. in detail the SDLC methodology focuses on the following phase of software development.
   1)requirement gathering :
     - during this phase all the relvant information is collected from the customer to develop a product as per their expection.
     - business analyst and project manager set up a meeting with customer to gather all the information like what the customer wants to build,customers requirement of product,what is the purspose of the product,knowledge of product is very important.
     - for example: a customer wants to online transactions.so we create software as per customer requirement like what kind of transaction will be done,in which currency it will be done.
     - once requirement gathering is done,then we create a software.
   2)analysis:
     - during this phase business analyst and project manager disscussed about requirement of customer and analysis on the information which they  gathering.
     - an analysis is done to check feasiblity  of the development of a product.this information should be throughly understood by the developers.
   3)designing:
     - in this phase, the requirement gathered,analysis is done and we need to design the software.
     - design the software is used as an input and software architecture  that is used for implementing system developmnet is derived.
  4) implementation:
     -implementation starts once the developer gets the design document.
     - all the compotantes of the software are implemented in this phase.
  5) testing: 
     -testing starts once the coding is complete. in this phase, the devloped software is tested throughly and any defects found  are assigned to developers to get them fixed.
     - retesting,regression  testing is done until the point at which the software is as per the customer's expectation.
  6) maintenance:
     -after the testing  of a product on the production environment,maintenance of the product. i.e.  if any issues comes up and needs to be fixed or any enhancement is to be done is taken  care by the developers.
