Q=1 What do you understand By Database.
 - A database is a structured collection of data organized for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation. 
 - It serves as a digital repository for storing and managing information, allowing users to easily access, update, and query data for various purposes, such as storing customer records, product information, or financial transactions.
 - Databases are essential for applications ranging from websites and mobile apps to business operations and scientific research. 
 - They help ensure data integrity, consistency, and security while enabling efficient data handling and analysis.


Q=2 What is Normalization? 
 - In database management systems (DBMS), normal forms are a series of guidelines that help to ensure that the design of a database is efficient, organized, and free from data anomalies.
 - There are several levels of normalization, each with its own set of guidelines, known as normal forms.
*First Normal Form (1NF): 
            -A table is in 1NF if it does not contain repeating groups and all entries in each column are atomic or indivisible.
            -In simpler terms, each column must have a single, indivisible value, and each row must be unique.

*Second Normal Form (2NF):
           - A table is in 2NF if it is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.
           - In other words, all the columns in the table must depend only on the entire primary key, not on a part of it.

*Third Normal Form (3NF):
           - A table is in 3NF if it is in 2NF and it does not have transitive dependencies.
           - Transitive dependency means that if A depends on B, and B depends on C, then A depends on C. 
           - In a table in 3NF, non-key columns are not dependent on other non-key columns.

Q=3 Difference between DBMS and RDBMS:
DBMS (Database Management System):
           - It is software that allows users to interact with the database.
           - It may or may not support a relational model for data storage and management.
RDBMS (Relational Database Management System):
           - It is a specific type of DBMS that follows the relational model for data storage and management.
           - In RDBMS, data is organized into tables with rows and columns, and it enforces data integrity through relationships and constraints.

Q=4 MF Cod Rule of RDBMS Systems:
           -There isn't a commonly known term "MF Cod Rule" in the context of RDBMS. 
           -It's possible that you meant something else or there might be a typo in the term.

Q=5 What do you understand By Data Redundancy?
    • Redundancy in relation may cause insertion, deletion and updation anomalies. So, it helps to minimize the redundancy in relations. 
    • Normalization is the process of minimizing redundancy (duplicity) from a relation or set of relations.

Q=6 What is DDL Interpreter?
  -When a user issues DDL statements, the DDL interpreter checks the syntax and semantics of the statements.
  -If the statements are correct, the interpreter translates them into a set of low-level operations that the DBMS can understand and execute. 
  -These operations are then executed to create, modify, or delete the specified database objects.

Q=7 What is DML Compiler in SQL?
  -DML (Data Manipulation Language) Compiler in SQL is a tool that helps you manage and interact with data in a database.
  -It processes commands like SELECT (to retrieve data), INSERT (to add new data), UPDATE (to modify existing data), and DELETE (to remove data) provided by users.
  -The DML Compiler checks these commands for errors, figures out the most efficient way to perform the requested actions, and then executes them, allowing users to work with the database easily.

Q=8  What is SQL Key Constraints writing an Example of SQL Key Constraints.
  -In SQL, key constraints are rules applied to columns in a table to enforce data integrity. There are several types of key constraints.

*Primary Key: Ensures that each record in a table is unique and not null. A table can have only one primary key.

*Unique Key: Ensures that all values in a column are unique, but unlike the primary key, it can contain null values.

*Foreign Key: Establishes a link between data in two tables. The foreign key in one table points to the primary key in another table.

Q=9 What is save Point? How to create a save Point write a Query? 
  -A SAVEPOINT is a point in a transaction when you can roll the transaction back to a certain point without rolling back the entire transaction.
Syntax:
  SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
-- Start a transaction
BEGIN;

-- Perform some operations
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, salary) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 50000);
UPDATE employees SET salary = 55000 WHERE id = 1;

-- Set a savepoint
SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;

-- If you want to roll back to the savepoint
ROLLBACK TO my_savepoint;

-- Commit the transaction
COMMIT;


Q=10 What is trigger and how to create a Trigger in SQL?
   • A trigger is a stored procedure in database which automatically invokes whenever a special event in the database occurs
   • For example, a trigger can be invoked when a row is inserted into a specified table.
Syntax:
      
   CREATE [OR REPLACE] TRIGGER trigger_name
   BEFORE/AFTER INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
   ON table_name
   [FOR EACH ROW]  -- This is optional and specifies that the trigger is row-level
 BEGIN
    -- Trigger body: SQL statements to be executed when the trigger is fired
 END;
